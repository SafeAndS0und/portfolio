                     Tableaux is a fancy french word for "images". And really that's all there is to it. Nothing but images (of cows for example). <br/>
                     I just used Pixabay's API to fetch the images and display it in a nice looking grid, added some basic functionality. <br/>
                     Simple but I was interested in writing good code with React and Redux rather than making new Instagram.

                     Corresponder is a chatting app.
                     This project probably concerns the most different programming areas (whole frontend and backend, webRTC) of all projects I did.
                     <br/> So it also makes it the most complicated project I worked on. <br/>
                     But I can't say it's the best one - almost half a year passed since I began working on it. I've learnt a lot throughout this time. <br/>
                     Sadly, I couldn't get it to work with webRTC on hosting but I guess you can try downloading the repo locally.
